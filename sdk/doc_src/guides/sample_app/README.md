#Sample Apps 

Sample Apps included in this SDK are standalone HTML5 web applications that demonstrate the use of AT&T APIs.

##Code Organization

The Sample Apps are located in the **webcontent** folder, organized by the APIs used. The **index.html** file lists each sample app and its corresponding documentation link.  The server side code is located in the **server** folders, and each app statically serves the client code. 

###Sample App feature folder
Each feature folder (for example, **SMS**) has subfolders for sample implementations (for example, _App1_, _App2_). Subfolders have a structure like the MVC implementation of the sample. The code that most directly illustrates the relevant AT&T API calls is located in the **controller** folder.
