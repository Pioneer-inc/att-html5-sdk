#Sample Apps 

Sample Apps included in this SDK are standalone HTML5 web applications that demonstrate the use of AT&T APIs.

##Code Organization

The Sample Apps are located in the **webcontent** folder, organized by the APIs used. The **index.html** file lists each sample app and its corresponding documentation link.  The server side code is located in the **server** folders, and each app statically serves the client code. 

###Sample App feature folder
In each feature folder (e.g. **SMS**) you will find folders for per each sample implementation (e.g. _App1_, _App2_). Each folder has a similar structure to that of the MVC implementation of the sample. The code that most directly illustrates the relevant AT&T API calls is located in the **controller** folder.
