Java Environment Setup
===

A version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) needs to be installed on the computer running the sample application.

**Note** Ant is required only if you plan to build and run the application from the command line.  If you aren't going to use the command line, or if you don't have cigwin set up on windows to execute shell scripts, we recommend you use Eclipse to build and run the application.

To Install JDK
---

- Download and install Java for your platform: <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>


Oracle offers many flavors of Java; however, the base JDK in any of the distribution is  sufficient to run the samples.

To Install Ant
---

- Download and install Ant, if necessary: <http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html>


Apache has a complete set of install instructions for all platforms.


To run your application from Eclipse
---

Download and install Eclipse: Any of the Java development versions will work.
