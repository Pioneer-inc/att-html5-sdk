AT&T HTML5 SDK Documentation Source. 
===

NOTE: To view the documentation you will need to download a documentation archive, which is separate from the SDK archive (ZIP file). After extracting the documentation ZIP file simply open index.html in your web browser.

This directory contains the Source files to generate the SDK documentation.

You must have JSDuck version 3 (an older version) installed to build the documentation:
